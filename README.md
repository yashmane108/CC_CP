# Flask Image Upload API

This project is a simple Flask-based web application that allows users to upload images. It validates the image file types and saves the uploaded images to a specified folder. The API provides a user-friendly interface to upload image files and returns a success or failure message.

## Features

- Allows users to upload images through a web interface.
- Validates file types for accepted image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP).
- Saves uploaded files to a server-side folder.
- Returns a response indicating whether the upload was successful or not.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask library

Run the Flask application:
python app.py

First Vision of this which is change 
after user upload file automatically upload in upload folder which is is project folder but after that i skip this and add pinata api key where when user upload file on web (browser see images for clearance) that get ipfs url which is accessible world wide with that url
simply store in local --> Store in pinata account(own which is free of cost remember 1GB storage is free) to access anywhere

any doubt create PR i will connect with you
